Feature: Automate validation
  validation should be quick and easy to maintain and run.

  Background: 
    Given that I loaded the Marketing Email Rule Order JSON file
    And that I loaded the Rules JSON file
    And there are no orphan Rules
    Then I connect to the Data File Under Test
    And there are data available
    And all Rules are correct

  @REGRESSION
  Scenario: See what credit declines are questionable based on selected rules in the data set under test.
    The tester should see credit declines that are in relation to the data file provided..
    When I enter the Rule number "1008"
    Then I should see credit declines that are questionable related to the data file

  @REGRESSION
  Scenario: See what credit declines are questionable based on on selected rules and an Overlay with CM 4 True in the data set under test.
    The tester should see credit declines that are questionable in relation to the data file provided..

    When I enter the Rule number "1008"
    And I have a Overlay with CM 4 equal to True
    Then I should see credit declines that are questionable in relation to the data file provided
